# Blackjack21

## Description

This game was recreated by adding a Singaporean twist to the most widely played casino banking game in the world!

## How to play

1. Player will have to place a bet of at least $5 from the $1000 credit given. 

2. Once a bet is made, the player can proceed to start the game by clicking the deal button.

3. Two cards each will be dealt to the player and the banker.

4. For the initial two cards, the player and banker will have a chance to get either blackjack (21) or ban ban (two aces).

5. Blackjack will allow the player to win or lose x 2 bet.

6. Ban Ban will allow the player to win or lose x 3 bet.

7. Aces amounts to 11 or 1 point, whichever that benefits the player to get as close to the value 21.

8. J, Q, K amounts to 10 points, and the rest of the value of the cards will be what it is. Eg 2 of spades = 2 points and 3 of hearts = 3 points etc.

9. If the initial two cards for the player amounts to 15, the player is given a choice to have a change of luck by the clicking the run button.

10. If the player decides to proceed with the two cards dealt to them, the player will be given a choice to double down or hit.

11. If the player choose to double down, a third card will be dealt to the player and the player will be forced to stand regardless of the total value of the cards (choose wisely).

12. If the player choose to hit, the goal is to get as close to 21 as possible.

13. If the player choose to stand for third card and above, the minimum value to stand is 16.

14. For the first three cards, the player will have a chance to win or lose x 7 bet if the player is dealt seven for the first three cards.
